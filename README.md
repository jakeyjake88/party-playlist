# Party Playlist

This is a team project designed and built over a 2 1/2 week period by Jake Price, Travers Geoffrey, Matt Leigh and Matt Reuther. It is an amatuer Spotify clone that allows users to functionally create a playlist, add songs, upvote songs you enjoy and manage playlists you own and contribute to other individuals playlists.

It features an interactive frontend written in JavaScript that provides users a fluid, functioning layout.

We ran through two week-long sprints and held daily scrum meetings to discuss design, planning and implementation of our project.
